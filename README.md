# About this Repository
This is a dockerfile for clanglibtooling sample including a tool to modify source code. Our goal is to use clang libtooling to modify the types of the target variables in `/Package/test.c` . 

Goal
-------------------------------------- 
This is `test.c`:

```c++
//The header is commented because handling header needs additional effort.
//#include <stdio.h>

void do_math(int *x) {
  double target3 = 1;   // need to change to int
  *x += 5;
}

int main(void) {
  double result = -1;
  long double target = 2.0;   //need to change to double
  int target2 = 2;   //need to change to long double
  int val = 4;
  do_math(&val);
  printf("abc\n");
  return result;
}
```

This is what we want our final code would be.

```c++
//The header is commented because handling header needs additional effort.
//#include <stdio.h>

void do_math(int *x) {
  int target3 = 1;   // need to change to int
  *x += 5;
}

int main(void) {
  double result = -1;
  double target = 2.0;   //need to change to double
  long double target2 = 2;   //need to change to long double
  int val = 4;
```

Prerequisites  
---------------------------------------  
To use this sample, Docker are required to be installed firstï¼Œ  
1. Install Docker: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

Usage  
--------------------------------------  
1. Clone this repository.
2. Change to `xuan-project` directory.
3. Run your Docker application. I would recommend to maximize the swap and memory that docker is able to use. Otherwise, docker may crash while building image. You can find this setting in Preferences->Advanced. I used 12GiB memory and 4GiB swap. You may also want to increase the disk image size to about 100GiB(It is in Preferences->Disk)
4. Run `docker build -t libtoolingsample .`.(This step takes several hours to complete. It took me 4.5 hours.)
5. Run `docker run -it libtoolingsample`.

# Running Demo

```
cd /root/Package
make clean
make
chmod 777 run.sh
./run.sh
```

You can see the oiriginal code and json config by using these commands
```
cat test.c
cat config.json
```
